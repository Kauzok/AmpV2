To kill.\n\nElectrocute.\n\nAn orphan, they said. Saved from a life spent in darkened alleyways, the only caveat being that he work for them without question. They called themselves scientists, visionaries, leaders. He called them slavers. For any disobedience was swiftly treated with high-voltage punishment.\n\nElectrocute.\n\nA new mission, they told him. Obtain an artifact from a desolate planet, said to contain the final remnant of a dead god's power. The details were left out; his safety wasn't a primary concern for them. If he died, they would simply use another. But when he touched the artifact, sparks flew. Images of a faraway planet, lush and teeming with life, flashed into his mind. He stumbled back, confused. What did this mean? What was this artifact? He knew if he followed the message, he’d find the answers. But first, there was something he must do. \n\nElectrocute.\n\nThe trail back to headquarters was stained with blood. He didn't have to go back. With his new power, he could've escaped and never returned. But he wanted vengeance.\n\nElectrocute.\n\nA trail of charred corpses behind him, he breaks into the boardroom. Desperate businessmen fire their sidearms, but the metallic bullets freeze mid-air, refusing to hit their target.

He felt them boring into his mind, a psionic attack that he was not prepared for. But he had become accustomed to his powers, and he protected his mind with an electric field while he made quick work of the [creature of cursed knowledge]. But he did not expect a suicide attack. \n\nCaptive once more. \n\nThey relentlessly experimented on the living, breathing, embodiment of electromagnetism, who rippled with the power of soul. They did so clinically, analytically, and yet with twisted excitement at finding a specimen possessing a portion of the bulwark’s power. \n\nHe feels it all. \n\nIn his abyssal cell there is nothing to see but darkness. No sound but the mechanical whirs of their scans. No feeling but the all-encompassing pain as [they who live in between] infect him with their own essence. But worse than the pain is the knowledge that he is once again, a prisoner. Once again, controlled by another. Once again. Once again. Once again. \n\nNever again. \n\nAnd when the [watchers of eternity] make the mistake of attempting to extract his power, of forgetting only two possessed the skill to direct unrestricted soul, he does not miss his chance. Atop the electrified rubble that was once his prison, he gazes upon the infinite sky, before turning his eyes to the wardens who have appeared to return him to his confinement. \n\nAnd he makes a promise. \n\nThe storm will rage until not even nothingness remains. \n\n",
